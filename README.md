# Odin Recipes

The goal of this project is to put into practice all of the HTML knowledge i have acquired so far at The Odin Project.  

I'm going to build a basic recipe website and it will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

### Website content:

- Lasagna
- Shrimp Grilled Cheese Sandwich
- Salmon Smash Burgers
